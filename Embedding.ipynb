To get there take a left right when you go into the park it is next to Great Moments with Abraham Lincoln.

There are original concepts of Disneyland, a video that go's through the history of Disneyland, old park tickets, trains from Walt, paintings and posters of Disneyland, miniature figurines of Disney park old and new, and much much more.

            "Result 1: Awesome attractions that blew my mind away. The attraction is filled with amazing rides and entertainment. There are also halal food that definitely cater to my needs. Glad to be able to meet Mickey and friends.\n",
            "Result 2: Disneyland a place of plastic dreams. Yes Disney is fun and everyone should go if they can. Stay away from the Matterhorn Bobsled ride, its a killer. By the time I crawled out of the sledge with a very sore neck & back I knew I would never ever ride it again, every turn was jarring so if you have bad necks, backs, hips, knees stay away for your own safety's sake. However I love its a small world and there are plenty of other rides to enjoy for all. If you don't want to blow out your ears bring ear plugs for the fireworks, so go ahead and enjoy.\n",
            "Result 3: Disneyland is a place where memories are made. When you start walking down Main street, your are taken to a whole different place. A place where you can be a kid again, and you can leave all your worries behind. There is something for everyone there. If you cant ride rides that's ok because there is so much to look at including shows, parades and even train and boat rides! Don't forget the music as you walk along you might here a Jazz band playing in New Orleans Square, or a Barber Shop Quartet singing on Main Street. If you have little kids there are still rides that they can go on as well. It really is a magical place that brings our family back time and time again.\n",
            "Result 4: It was a long couple of days but so worth it. From 10am to 11pm we experienced some great thrills. Space mountain in particular was a blast. Literally. The live performance of Frozen was a real treat. The best was the run away train. When it did not break down. It seems an overhaul of this ride is needed but it was brilliant none the less. \n",
            "Result 5: Amazing place for kids and adults too. Lots of rides, fun games. Dont miss the gala Disney walk that happens every evening.\n",

            "Result 1: I have been to Disneyland in LA, and thought all Disneyland's were identical. They are not, as obviously there can could be geographical constraints or economic restraints. If you haven't been to any of the Disneyland's around the world and you are in HK, then come. If you have been to Disneyland in LA you will be disappointed \n",
            "Result 2: When I arrived at the Hong Kong Disneyland,it started raining. So I decided not to buytickets to enter the place. For senior citizen( 65 years of age ) it was only HK$100 for the entrance fee. I didn't feel sorry as I havebeen here many years ago. Having also beento both Disneyland in Anaheim Californiaand Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney) I foundthat the floorplan landscaping is the same asHong Kong Disneyland. Worth a visit !\n",
            "Result 3: Anyone wanting to experience Disneyland, let Hong Kong Disneyland be your first choice before visiting other Disneyland ie. JapanUSA etc cos Hong Kong Disneyland is much much smaller and there's really nothing much to explore. If you've been to Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea like me, you'll sure be disappointed at HK Disneyland!\n",
            "Result 4: Compared to Los Angeles and Tokyo Disneyland, HK Disneyland is jut average but if you are a first timer, that's OK\n",
            "Result 5: My family and I have been to Euro Disney in France, Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida. On this family trip, we are going to Hong Kong Disneyland and in a couple days, we'll visit Shanghai Disneyland. I guess maybe I was expecting too much from Hong Kong Disneyland. While we enjoyed the public train ride to the resort, it was overwhelming unorganized, as people pushed to get on and off and rushed to get into the park. All we can say is that we were here and one item off our bucket list. Here's to hoping Shanghai Disneyland will not disappoint.\n",

            "Result 1: We have been to Disneyland in Hong Kong 4 times since 2010 and enjoyed every minute there. I agree Disneyland in the USA is great but for travel to and from Brisbane is 15 hours compared to 8 hours to Hong Kong and expense for a family I would recommend Hong Kong anytime.\n",
            "Result 2: We spent the whole day in Hong Kong Disneyland. Hong Kong Disneyland is an ideal choice for a family tour especially with children.\n",
            "Result 3: We had a lovely time at Disneyland Hong Kong! Not as big as Los Angeles Disneyland, but still get that wonderful Disney vibe! Happily spent 2 days here.\n",
            "Result 4: Considering the value of land in this tiny city of Hong Kong, I was prepared to see a miniature Disneyland. I wasn't surprised when I was actually there. I bought a three day pass for Disneyland Park in Anaheim, LA, but for this one in Hong Kong, a day pass is enough already.\n",
            "Result 5: My wife and I spent the day at Disneyland Paris on our recent visit to Paris. We have previously been to Disneyland California and Disneyland Paris is in many ways a smaller carbon copy. We both enjoyed our time at Disneyland Paris, but I do not feel that it is as good as Disneyland California. We easily covered both 'parks' at Disneyland Paris in one day. By comparison we spent a full three days in Disneyland California. However, the park was well run, well maintained and was a very enjoyable day out. The closing fireworks and lightshow was very spectacular and worth the visit in and of itself. If you are after the 'Disney experience' in Paris Europe this is very much worth a visit.\n",

And every time I go I discover new things that I love about the park. Last time I went I found the Disney Gallery. To get there take a left right when you go into the park it is next to Great Moments with Abraham Lincoln. If you want to find out about the history of Disneyland and collect Disneyland memorabilia you have to stop here. There are original concepts of Disneyland, a video that go's through the history of Disneyland, old park tickets, trains from Walt, paintings and posters of Disneyland, miniature figurines of Disney park old and new, and much much more. In my opinion that is a must see especially if you like the history of Disneyland like me!\n",

All of the rides and ambiance is there but the delivery is not the same. Overall for a regular park it is great, and it is reasonably priced but if you have been spoiled by going to the Orlando park you will be a little disappointed here.

            "Result 4: You've probably all heard that it's the happiest place on earth, well it genuinely is. From the buildings to the cobble street. Christmas music. Fake snow, December is the best time to go. The rides are brilliant and meeting all the characters is great fun. We didn't bring any children with us because you are never to old for Disney land !. As expected everything is very pricey so if you need essential things like umbrellas and that. La valley is the next stop on the train which has a primark for a fraction of the price. The queues are long and the estimation time for the line is always a little less than what they say but stick it out and enjoy all the rides. Pirates of the Caribbean was my favourite. And the light show is absolutely fantastic but make sure you get a good spot as unfortunately I was stuck behind a man who had put his child on his shoulders and his wife with her umbrella up so choose wisely.\n",

We love this place, the rides, attractions, shows, food and endless things to do while here. Unfortunately they will be closing down our favorite eatery in the park  Big Thunder Ranch BBQ  due to the new  Star Wars  land they are in the process of making. No matter there is still so many great eats here. The rides are always fun and good for a laugh here as well. Nothing bad to say as we all know it gets packed and of course that so cal sun is always beaming down on ya. Walking down main street is always a beautiful thing to see the castle at the far end. Love it forever.\n",
